# docs/todo — open work index

Agents: read this file instead of listing or skimming all of `docs/todo/`.  
When a task is finished → fold into [`HISTORY.md`](HISTORY.md), delete the todo file, update this index, and remove finished checkboxes from `WORKPLAN.md` / other active trackers.

Status values: `open` | `blocked` | `partial`.

## Fold rule (copy into CLAUDE / chat)

```
Done task → append summary to docs/todo/HISTORY.md → delete docs/todo/<file>.md
         → remove row from INDEX.md → strip finished items from WORKPLAN.md
Never leave **Status:** done files in docs/todo/.
```
