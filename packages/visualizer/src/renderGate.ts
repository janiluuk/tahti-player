/**
 * Should this WebGL surface draw a frame right now?
 *
 * theDAW keeps five three.js scenes alive at once — the assistant orb, two
 * cymatics visualizers in MAKE, the CRISPR DNA card behind the Chimera area,
 * and the boot title — and every one of them ran its `requestAnimationFrame`
 * loop forever. The panels that hold them are hidden with `display:none` when
 * another workspace is open (see AdvancedView and DAWCenterPanel, which warm-
 * mount rather than unmount so in-flight state survives), so two full scenes
 * kept rendering at 60fps behind EDIT, MIX, PERFORM, DJ and VJ, drawing on the
 * same GPU that is loading and running the diffusion model.
 *
 * `document.hidden` — which those loops already checked — only covers the
 * whole window being minimised or backgrounded. It says nothing about a panel
 * the user has navigated away from, which is the case that actually happens.
 *
 * The gate answers both, cheaply: an IntersectionObserver is push-based, so
 * the per-frame question is a boolean read, not a layout query. Never call
 * `getBoundingClientRect` from a render loop to answer this — that forces a
 * synchronous layout on every frame and costs more than the frame it skips.
